# Chill gui fixed-
TO GET THIS TO WORK, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE workspace:WaitForChild("name") TO THE ROBLOX ACCOUNT YOU ARE USING THIS SCRIPT ON. (Found on line 2) <br>
A quick fix for the popular chill gui script.<br>

After 1 failed attempt at this i decided to go again.<br>
All that had to be done was fixing parenting the billboard gui to players head and fixing part parenting to torso CFrame<br>
I know my code isnt great lol<br>
