# Chill gui fixed-
# How to use
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE workspace:WaitForChild("name") TO THE ROBLOX ACCOUNT YOU ARE USING THIS SCRIPT ON. (Found on line 2) <br>
           <br>
If your gettig the warning: Infinite yeild possible on 'Workspace:WaitForChild("the name you put on line 2"), then you have typed the name wrong<br>
This means the game is infinitly waiting for a player that doesnt exist, therefore the script will not work :(

# Why?
After 1 failed attempt at this i decided to go again since its my fav script.<br>

# What I had to fix
All that had to be done was fixing parenting the billboard gui to players head and fixing part parenting to torso CFrame<br>
Im aware the audio or volume thigns may be broken<br>

I will make updated version eventually so you dont need to replace workspace:WaitForChild() with your name every time<br>
