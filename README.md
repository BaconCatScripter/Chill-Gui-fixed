# Chill gui fixed-
#H ow to use
YOU HAVE TO CHANGE workspace:WaitForChild("name") TO THE ROBLOX ACCOUNT YOU ARE USING THIS SCRIPT ON. (Found on line 2) <br>

# Why?
After 1 failed attempt at this i decided to go again since its my fav script.<br>

# What I had to fix
All that had to be done was fixing parenting the billboard gui to players head and fixing part parenting to torso CFrame<br>
Im aware the audio or volume thigns may be broken<br>
